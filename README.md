# 🧪 Funnel Conversion Analysis Project

This project explores user behavior through a classic **e-commerce funnel** using exploratory data analysis (EDA), user segmentation, and conversion insights.

## 📁 Project Structure


---

## 📌 Objective

To analyze user behavior across the funnel stages:

- **Home Page**
- **Search Page**
- **Payment Page**
- **Confirmation Page**

…and identify **conversion rates**, **drop-off rates**, and **possible improvement points** using data.

---

## 📊 Key Findings

- **Total Users:** 90,000
- **Drop-off (Home → Search):** 50.00% (45,200 users)
- **Drop-off (Search → Payment):** 86.66%
- **Drop-off (Payment → Confirmation):** 92.50%

Only **1.25%** of users reached the final confirmation step, revealing a high abandonment rate post-search.

---

## 🔍 Bonus Segment Analysis

- **By Gender:**
  - Female users had slightly better retention through search.
- **By Device:**
  - Desktop users showed higher conversion rates than Mobile.

This segmentation helps target performance improvements (e.g., mobile UX optimization or search friction reduction).

---

## 📦 Tools Used

- **Python (Pandas, Plotly, Seaborn, Matplotlib)**
- **Google Colab** for analysis
- **Markdown** for documentation
- **Optional:** Streamlit/Dash for dashboard (extendable)

---

## 📈 Possible Improvements

- Track **reason for drop-off** (e.g., button clicks, cart abandonment)
- Add **session duration** or **time spent** per step
- Apply **A/B testing** on payment UI
- Develop a **predictive model** for churn risk
